##  Description 
I developed a user-friendly calendar application for web browsers that allows users to easily manage their daily schedules. The app lets users input their schedules and save them for later access. It features a visually appealing and dynamic interface powered by jQuery. Additionally, the application is efficient and lightweight, optimized for quick access to events without slowing down the device. Overall, my application is a practical tool suitable for personal or professional use.

## Installation

## Features

The page encompasses several notable features, including the capacity for users to save added events to local storage and the application's ability to re-append the saved data to the page upon reload. Additionally, the page employs two distinct content delivery networks (CDNs) to display the current time, which are subsequently processed through an iterative and conditional statement to produce the visually distinctive color-coordinated time blocks that are presented to the user.
